# My Developer Website

This is the code repository for my [developer website](https://haraldofilho.github.io/).

The purpose of the site is to provide additional information about my professional life and my credentials as a software developer. It was written in _**Javascript**_, _**HTML**_ and _**CSS**_, 
and it is composed of six "cards" with a LinkedIn badge, a GitHub Languages graph (provided by the user [IonicaBizau](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/) in the repository [github-profile-languages](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-profile-languages)), my academic degree, certifications and courses attended.
